        <h2>Why theology?</h2>
        <p>Theology shapes the laws and the mores of people. They have their traditions, their beliefs, their virtues, their vices. I find it fascinating
        to know these laws and mores and to study them in detail and in context. I like to study what the Enlightenment era thinkers have to say as well
        as studying the history and the contexts in which religions have lived.</p>
        <p>For many religions this has a benefit of knowing their predecessors. Islam views Christinity as a prior virtuous religion. Christianity views Judaism
        as their prior religion.</p> 
        <p>Likewise they all interact with each other and create societies. America is the epitome of this, having many of the religions of the world contained
        in one polity.</p>
