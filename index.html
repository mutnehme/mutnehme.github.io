        <p>Hello there. This is Mark's website. Currently under construction. 
        </p>
        <p>I am currently learning HTML from the ground up hence the basicness of this website. It will look nicer over time</p>
        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I am a professional software engineer looking to broaden my skills, learn more about programming, and also share my thoughts with
            the world. I am going to use this website as a central repository for my writings about code, literature, movies and various
            philosophical ramblings. 
        </p>
